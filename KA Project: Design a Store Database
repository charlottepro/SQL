--Create a convenience store database: Create your own store! Your store should sell one type of things, like clothing or bikes, whatever you want your store to specialize in.
  You should have a table for all the items in your store, and at least 5 columns for the kind of data you think you'd need to store. 
  You should sell at least 15 items, and use select statements to order your items by price and show at least one statistic about the items.

CREATE TABLE store (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, snackname TEXT, price INTEGER, aisle INTEGER, experation_date TEXT);

INSERT INTO store VALUES (1, "good n plenty", 6.50, 4, "10/25/24");
INSERT INTO store VALUES (3, "coke ina bottle", 3.75, 3, "8/7/24");
INSERT INTO store VALUES (4, "bottled water", 2.00, 3, "9/17/24");
INSERT INTO store VALUES (5, "small chips", 4.00, 5,"5/12/24");
INSERT INTO store VALUES (6, "large chips", 6.00, 5, "6/4/24");
INSERT INTO store VALUES (7, "energy drink", 3.85, 3, "7/14/24");
INSERT INTO store VALUES (8, "hot dog", 2.50, 1, "FRESH");
INSERT INTO store VALUES (9, "hot pickle", 1.80, 1, "FRESH");
INSERT INTO store VALUES (10, "hot coffee", 3.00, 1, "FRESH");
INSERT INTO store VALUES (11, "hot chocolate", 2.75, 1, "FRESH");
INSERT INTO store VALUES (12, "popcorn", 3.00, 5, "FRESH" );
